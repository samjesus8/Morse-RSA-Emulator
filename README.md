# Morse Code & RSA Emulator - CCCU Year 1 Assignment - C# Application Development

This project was undertaken during Year 1 of my Computer Science BSc degree where I had to make a C# Windows forms application which can Encode/Decode Morse code & RSA. All the project files were forked and copied over from the CCCU repo which I used to work on the project during the study

## Morse Code

The following function can Encode/Decode Morse Code into Plaintext and the other way back. You simply put in your input at the top and press ENCODE or DECODE
Pressing the Import button allows you to import .txt files and convert betweeen morse and plain text
